            Gyeongpo Beach in Anhyeon-dong, Gangneung-si, Gangwon-do is one of the best beaches to visit in the summertime. <br>
            There is saying, if you want to feel the youthful energy of Korea during the hot summer, go to Haeundae in Busan or Gyeongpodae in Gangneung. <br>
            <br>Many young people come to Gyeongpo Beach and as a result family visitors have spread to other beaches in Yangyang and Goseong. <br>
            <br>Gyeongpo is famous for being the longest coastal beach. <br>
            Located 6km to the north of the city center and 1km from Gyeongpodae Pavilion, <br>the beach shows off the clear waters of the East Sea along and shining sand. <br>
            The parasols that cover the beach in the summertime look as if paint has been splashed on the beach and create a splendid view. <br>
            <br>Only after seeing this sight has your Gangneung travels truly begun.

            Gyeongpo Eco Marsh Park is a park adjacent to the Gyeongpoho Lake. <br><br>
            Upon entering the entrance of the park, there appear lotus and prickly waterlily flowers. <br><br>
            Sometimes, the prickly waterlily flowers cannot be seen in the foxnut marsh, <br>so it is necessary to check appropriate seasons or visiting times in advance. <br>
            In particular, visitors can go for a walk without any difficulty along a well-organized trail and deck. <br>
            <br>Above all, there are rare prickly waterlily flowers which revived within half a century.
